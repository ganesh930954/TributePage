        Novak Djokovic took a racquet in his hands for the first time when he
        was four years old. It was summer, and one of the best tennis coaches,
        Jelena Gencic, was holding a training camp. Every day Novak came by and
        watched the trainings. Then, one day, Jelena invited him on the court.
        He accepted, and started playing tennis.

        “I knew he would become a champion. It was crystal clear to me. He was
        focused, conscientious, and above all, talented.” – Jelena Gencic

        Although he enjoyed skiing, and even football, it was tennis that won
        him over – as well as Pete Sampras whose game on the court Novak fully
        absorbed.

        meant to be!” – Novak Djokovic
